### About the Project

This game was developed as part of the **Ironhack Web Developer Bootcamp** module 1 final project, so that the knowledge acquired about HTML, CSS and JavaScript could be put into practice in a real project.

### About the Game

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. Instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.
